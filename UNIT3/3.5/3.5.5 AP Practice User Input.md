# 3.5.5 AP Practice: User Input

1. On the AP exam, INPUT() is used to accept a value from the user and DISPLAY() is used to display a value. Values that are displayed are NOT started on a new line but do contain a space following the value printed.

Consider the code segment below.

```
DISPLAY ("What is your name?")
name ← INPUT ()
DISPLAY ("Hello")
DISPLAY (name)
```

What is displayed as a result if the user inputs “Karel” to the program?

**What is your name? Karel**

**Hello Karel**
