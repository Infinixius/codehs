# 3.4.5 AP Practice: Variables

1. On the AP exam, the ← operator is used for variable assignment. For example, `a ← 10` assigns the value 10 to the variable a.

Consider the following code segment.

```
a ← 10 
b ← 5 
c ← a + b
```

What is stored in variable c?

**15**

2. The value stored in a variable will always be the most recent value assigned.

Consider the following code segment.

```
a ← 1
b ← a 
a ← 2 
```

What value is stored in variable b?
